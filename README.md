# Advent24

Create a new internal class in the Solutions folder and implement the abstract Solution class, here you need to pass an integer to the base class. 
Put a txt-file in each of the input folder, one with the testinput and one with the real input.
These files will be automatically read when running the solution.

When running the project it will search for all available solutions and give you the option to choose one.
